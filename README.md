This code performs image classification using a VGG-19 model with dropout regularization. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries, including PyTorch, torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
Dataset Preparation:

Copy a combined dataset to the working directory.
Define the path to the dataset and set parameters such as image size, batch size, epochs, and the number of folds for K-fold cross-validation.
Data Transformations:

Define transformations for training and validation/test sets, including random cropping, rotation, flipping, color jittering, and resizing.
Dataset Loading:

Load the full dataset with the specified train transformations.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (70%, 15%, 15%).
Data Loaders:

Create data loaders for training, validation, and test sets.
Model Definition:

Set up a VGG-19 model with a modified classifier containing dropout.
Initialize optimizer (AdamW) and learning rate scheduler.
Training Loop:

Perform K-fold cross-validation.
For each fold, train the model using the specified DataLoader.
Evaluate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) on both training and validation sets.
Performance Metrics Calculation:

Use scikit-learn's precision_recall_fscore_support to compute precision, recall, and F1 score.
Track various metrics for each epoch and fold.
Results Storage:

Store fold-wise results, including accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Averaging Metrics:

Compute average metrics over all folds.
Results Visualization:

Plot average metrics across epochs, including accuracy, loss, precision, recall, for both training and validation sets.
In summary, the code trains a VGG-19 model with dropout regularization on a dataset using K-fold cross-validation. It tracks and stores various performance metrics and visualizes the average metrics across epochs. Additionally, the code includes error handling to skip batches if a file is not found during training.
